\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
With the continuous development of mobile devices and intelligent technologies, mobile gaming has become an integral part of people's everyday entertainment. Among them, real-time battle games have gained popularity among players due to their interactivity and competitiveness. However, traditional real-time battle games often rely on screen touch or button controls, limiting the players' means of control and their overall gaming experience. In order to enhance immersion and entertainment, we aim to develop a ninja-themed real-time battle game based on Android platform, by integrating voice recognition and gesture recognition technologies, allowing players to unleash skills through natural and intuitive movements and sounds, thus achieving a more immersive gaming experience.
\subsection{Problem statement}
In traditional real-time battle games, players control their characters and unleash skills through screen touch or buttons, which may not be intuitive or natural for some players, limiting their control abilities and overall gaming experience. Furthermore, due to the limitations of these control methods, the competitiveness and interactivity of the game are somewhat constrained. Therefore, our challenge is to develop a ninja-themed real-time battle game based on voice recognition and gesture recognition technologies, offering more intuitive and natural control methods, and enhancing the game's competitiveness and interactivity.
\subsection{Existing solutions and their problems}
Currently, there are some experimental games that utilize voice recognition and gesture recognition. However, they may face certain challenges. On one hand, existing solutions may have limitations in terms of accuracy and response speed of skill triggering, leading to delays and imprecise player actions. On the other hand, the variety and personalization of skills and control methods provided in the game may be lacking, failing to meet the diverse needs and combat strategies of players.
\subsection{Proposed solution}
To overcome these challenges, our solution is to develop a ninja-themed real-time battle game based on voice recognition and gesture recognition technologies. By implementing advanced voice recognition and gesture recognition algorithms, we achieve precise skill triggering and response speed, allowing players to control their characters and unleash skills through natural gestures and sounds. Additionally, we provide a diverse range of combat skills, enabling players to choose suitable skill combinations based on their preferences and combat strategies. Through extensive testing and optimization, we ensure the stability and smoothness of the game, delivering an exceptional user experience and entertainment value. We believe that our solution will offer players a fresh gaming experience and explore the potential application value of voice recognition and gesture recognition in the gaming domain.

\subsection{Customer interviews}
To gather comprehensive feedback and understand various users' perspectives on our app, we conducted interviews with 10 users and compiled the following result：

\subsubsection*{Participant1:} 
I have never watched Naruto.

I know little about how ninja fight with each other.

I think it would be a fantastic game and I will have a try. I have never experienced such game before.

I prefer Honor of Kings and PUBG

I think Fighting game is not comfortable on mobile phones

PC game is inconvenient both on time and place, so I prefer mobile game
Don't have any preference on mobile game's art style

Prefer third-person view games rather than platform 2D games.

I have only experienced gesture control in screen, like in ipone, never experienced any games with such feature.

Mac has gesture capture, but only can reconginize fingers.

For voice recognition, I have only used on siri, not for entertainment usage.

Capture recoginition might be not flexible enough, it will definitely influence user experience.

\subsubsection*{Participant2:} 
I still remeber the anime Naruto, it is one of the favorite animes in my life.

My memory about ninja is that they can use a lot of skills shouting out the skill names

I think it would be cool ninja-theme game is an online game.

I prefer the game's art style to be 3D.

I never played any games with gesture capture.

I only experienced voice recoginition in Siri.

I prefer mobile games rather than PC games for they are cheap

I expect the ninjas can move around and play perform their skills with player's voice.

Don't know how to control characters with gesture.

\subsubsection*{Participant3:} 
I of course know Naruto. I like it very much.

My impression about ninjas' fighting is that they use cool and colorful skills in the war.

I would appreciate such game for players to fight as a ninja.

I like to play card games on mobile phones since they don't take a lot of time.

I've heard of there's a mobile phone game directly realted to Naruto, but I've never played it.

I prefer fantasy art style.

Add AR and GPS: like PokemanGo.

I expect the game with AR/VR can have features such as Sociality.

I've experienced two voice recognition software: Xunfei for meeting recording and Sonic for audio to text software.

I've experienced Gesture Recoginition software: Huawei gesture recoginition.

\subsubsection*{Participant4:}
I don't konw much about Naturo, only know that there are many very powerful ninja, able to use powerful ninjutsu

Different ninjas use their own jutsu to defeat the enemy

I think the game with ninja-theme is interesting, never thought it before.

Didn't know whether games with ninja-theme exist

Prefer 王者荣耀or和平精英, play it everyday

No experience on games about Naturo before,  would expect some interesting way of fighting

I would expect like real fight, not just like cards fight

I think the potential disadvantages of the gesture and voice recogintion is that they are not usually as accurate as expected

Would be interested in such game, seems interesting and never played before.

In memory, no, only know some AR games popular like Pokemon go

\subsubsection*{Participant5:}
The most impressive is Sasuke's apparent wheel eyes.

Ninjas use Ninjutsu to defeat the enemy

Would be interested in it! and want to have a try

Never heard of games related to Ninja, only know some card game about Njnja

I only play PC games like CSgo and Pubg, don't play mobile games at all
past experience is like 10 years ago, card games, similar to 梦幻西游, card games, most interseting thing about them is that they have many ninjutsus

Like RPG mode is prefered, I can be a ninjutsu myself and fight

There are hardware limitions, and in many situations they are not practial to use

Would expect different kinds of cool ninjutsus.

No such game seen before

\subsubsection*{Participant6:}
A very classic Japanese anime, several hundred episodes

Ninjas use Ninjutsu to defeat the enemy

Sounds great, and would have a try

Ninja-theme game would be very cool, and interesting

Never heard of such kind of game, and no experience on games based on topic of Ninja

Like casual games, such as subway parkour, play games when boring or on the train and without internet

would prefer Self-playing chess or something like that

not very practical, seems cannot be used in noise situations like when on the subway

Would expect different kinds of cool ninjutsus.

\subsubsection*{Participant7:}
Haven't heard about Naruto ever

My impression on how ninja's fight with each other is that they perform different gestures for different use.

It will be interesting to have a try with a game related to ninja and gesture recongnition.

No such a game with ninja theme

Honor of kings is the favorite one which is PVP and simple

Hope it will be easy to learn and requires less time to finish a round

Of course anmine with good-looking actors

Gesture recognition is often frame-based instead of video streaming based.

I would expect both of gesture and voice recogntion could be utilized well

Have heard of some games on gesture control but don't have a deep impression.

\subsubsection*{Participant8:}
Naruto is an impressive design in Japanese animation

Ninjas use different combination of skills to attack others

A good idea to combine voice and gesture recognition, willing to have a try

No such a game with ninja related topic.

I prefer game that cost a few time to complete a round

I would expect your game to have various mode and enough exploration space

I have no spectial preference for game's art style.

Practical use on mobile app is hardly seen

Will be able to capture gesture accurately is enough

I have never heard of apps with gesture and voice recognition.

\subsubsection*{Participant9:}
Naruto is my favorite Janpanese anime

Various gesture categories and fantastic performances

I would be happy to have a try with game related to ninja.

Haven't heard of such game with ninja theme.

Easy to begin a round like heartstone and interesting to keep playing

Hope it will be able to recognize some interesting gesture and reasonable matching rules

For art style, I think anime will be better

Speech recognition application is widely used in loT but gesture recognition is not used widely

Combination of both modal recognition will be a novelty

No such an app with gesture recognition.
\subsubsection*{Participant10:}
Used to see in a lot of video cut for Naruto.

A very special and impressive competition way.

Worth trying for a game as you described.

No such a game with ninja theme.

PUBG is most usually played, it is easy to begin and worth exploration

Friendly to beginners but have large improvement space for advanced players

Anime art style.

Seems no game app use either techniques(voice and gesture recognition)

The application of either technique on games is attractive enough

No such an app with gesture recognition.
\subsection{Affinity map}
Based on the data that we have collected from the interview, we draw the affinity map that is shown below:
\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Pain Points of customers}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Competitor analysis}
After conducting extensive market research, we have identified several similar games and summarized some of their key features.
\subsubsection*{Pokemon Go}
Pokemon Go is an AR mobile app that is based on pokemon collection, and is one vs. one battle. The strength of Pokemon Go is AR, abundant gameplay and artwork, the weakness of it is the ordinary interactive mechanism.

\subsubsection*{Scream Go Hero}
This is a mobile app that use the volume of the player's voice to control the character (a ninja in particular). The strength of it is the interesting mechanism using volume as control, the weakness of it is there are rather too few contents.

\subsubsection*{Words follow the speaker's intent（言出法随）}
This is a pc game, users speak out names of moves to release the characters in the game, the strength of this game is for the interesting mechanism using voice recognition, the weakness of it is the poor gameplay and artwork.

\subsubsection*{Hand Music}
This is an iOS app that can recognize position of hands to play music, the strength of this game is the hand recognition, the weakness of this game is that it is hardly a complete product.

\subsubsection*{Silhouette}
This is a VR app that is able to recognize gesture for all kinds of interaction, the strength of it is for very interesting mechanism using gesture recognition, the weakness of this app is that a VR device is needed.

Based on the competitor analysis, we can get the following table:

\begin{table}[]
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
               & Gesture Recognition & Voice Recognition & Abundant Gameplay & Extra Feature & Mobile app(no extra device needed) \\ \hline
Pokemon Go     & N                   & N                 & Y                 & Y(AR)         & Y                                  \\ \hline

Hand Music     & Y(only hand )       & N                 & N                 & N             & Y                                  \\ \hline
Silhouette     & Y                   & N                 & Y                 & N             & N                                  \\ \hline
Ninja          & Y                   & Y                 & N                 & Y(Unity)      & Y                                  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}

\section*{NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF HOMOGENEOUS CHARGE COMPRESSION IGNITION COMBUSTION FUELED WITH DIMETHYL ETHER}%英文大摘要标题

HCCI (Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition) combustion has advantages in terms of efficiency and reduced emission. HCCI combustion can not only ensure both the high economic and dynamic quality of the engine, but also efficiently reduce the NOx and smoke emission. Moreover, one of the remarkable characteristics of HCCI combustion is that the ignition and combustion process are controlled by the chemical kinetics, so the HCCI ignition time can vary significantly with the changes of engine configuration parameters and operating conditions. ……%(英文大摘要正文)
